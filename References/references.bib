  abstract={Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a simple and low-cost optical technique that can be used to detect blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissue. It is often used non-invasively to make measurements at the skin surface. The PPG waveform comprises a pulsatile ('AC') physiological waveform attributed to cardiac synchronous changes in the blood volume with each heart beat, and is superimposed on a slowly varying ('DC') baseline with various lower frequency components attributed to respiration, sympathetic nervous system activity and thermoregulation. Although the origins of the components of the PPG signal are not fully understood, it is generally accepted that they can provide valuable information about the cardiovascular system. There has been a resurgence of interest in the technique in recent years, driven by the demand for low cost, simple and portable technology for the primary care and community based clinical settings, the wide availability of low cost and small semiconductor components, and the advancement of computer-based pulse wave analysis techniques. The PPG technology has been used in a wide range of commercially available medical devices for measuring oxygen saturation, blood pressure and cardiac output, assessing autonomic function and also detecting peripheral vascular disease. The introductory sections of the topical review describe the basic principle of operation and interaction of light with tissue, early and recent history of PPG, instrumentation, measurement protocol, and pulse wave analysis. The review then focuses on the applications of PPG in clinical physiological measurements, including clinical physiological monitoring, vascular assessment and autonomic function.}

abstract = {Remote measurements of the cardiac pulse can provide comfortable physiological assessment without electrodes. However, attempts so far are non-automated, susceptible to motion artifacts and typically expensive. In this paper, we introduce a new methodology that overcomes these problems. This novel approach can be applied to color video recordings of the human face and is based on automatic face tracking along with blind source separation of the color channels into independent components. Using Bland-Altman and correlation analysis, we compared the cardiac pulse rate extracted from videos recorded by a basic webcam to an FDA-approved finger blood volume pulse (BVP) sensor and achieved high accuracy and correlation even in the presence of movement artifacts. Furthermore, we applied this technique to perform heart rate measurements from three participants simultaneously. This is the first demonstration of a low-cost accurate video-based method for contact-free heart rate measurements that is automated, motion-tolerant and capable of performing concomitant measurements on more than one person at a time.},

  abstract={Over 100 algorithms have been proposed to estimate respiratory rate (RR) from the electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG). As they have never been compared systematically it is unclear which algorithm performs the best. Our primary aim was to determine how closely algorithms agreed with a gold standard RR measure when operating under ideal conditions. Secondary aims were: (i) to compare algorithm performance with IP, the clinical standard for continuous respiratory rate measurement in spontaneously breathing patients; (ii) to compare algorithm performance when using ECG and PPG; and (iii) to provide a toolbox of algorithms and data to allow future researchers to conduct reproducible comparisons of algorithms. Algorithms were divided into three stages: extraction of respiratory signals, estimation of RR, and fusion of estimates. Several interchangeable techniques were implemented for each stage. Algorithms were assembled using all possible combinations of techniques, many of which were novel. After verification on simulated data, algorithms were tested on data from healthy participants. RRs derived from ECG, PPG and IP were compared to reference RRs obtained using a nasal-oral pressure sensor using the limits of agreement (LOA) technique. 314 algorithms were assessed. Of these, 270 could operate on either ECG or PPG, and 44 on only ECG. The best algorithm had 95% LOAs ofâ€‰â€‰âˆ’4.7 to 4.7 bpm and a bias of 0.0 bpm when using the ECG, andâ€‰â€‰âˆ’5.1 to 7.2 bpm and 1.0 bpm when using PPG. IP had 95% LOAs ofâ€‰â€‰âˆ’5.6 to 5.2 bpm and a bias ofâ€‰â€‰âˆ’0.2 bpm. Four algorithms operating on ECG performed better than IP. All high-performing algorithms consisted of novel combinations of time domain RR estimation and modulation fusion techniques. Algorithms performed better when using ECG than PPG. The toolbox of algorithms and data used in this study are publicly available.}

ABSTRACT = {Photoplethysmography (PPG) technology has been used to develop small, wearable, pulse rate sensors. These devices, consisting of infrared light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and photodetectors, offer a simple, reliable, low-cost means of monitoring the pulse rate noninvasively. Recent advances in optical technology have facilitated the use of high-intensity green LEDs for PPG, increasing the adoption of this measurement technique. In this review, we briefly present the history of PPG and recent developments in wearable pulse rate sensors with green LEDs. The application of wearable pulse rate monitors is discussed.},

Heart and respiration rates could be quantified up to several harmonics. Although the green channel featuring the strongest plethysmographic signal, corresponding to an absorption peak by (oxy-) hemoglobin, the red and blue channels also contained plethysmographic information.

Common pulse oximeters, however, involving light of 660 and 940 nm, are so insensitive to the presence of fetal hemoglobin that they can be used safely in neonates. The error in pulse oximetry caused by the presence of carboxyhemoglobin is insubstantial, but methemoglobin gives either an understimation or an overestimation at high or low oxygen saturation, respectively, the turning point being near 70\% saturation.},

abstract = {Abstract We present study results on visible light reflection photoplethysmographic (PPG) imaging with a mobile cellular phone operated in video imaging mode. PPG signal components around 0.1 Hz attributed to the sympathetic component of the heart rate, 1 Hz as the heart rate and 2 Hz as heart rate high order harmonic were quantified on the index finger of a healthy volunteer. The green channel reported PPG signals throughout the sampled area. The blue and red channel returned plethysmographic information, but the signal strength was highly position specific. Our results obtained with a cellular phone as the data acquisition device are encouraging, especially in the broad context of personal or home-based care and the role of cellular phone technology in medical imaging.

    abstract = {Recent progress in information and communication technologies has made it possible to measure heart rate (HR) and normalized pulse volume (NPV), which are important physiological indices, using only a smartphone. This has been achieved with reflection mode photoplethysmography (PPG), by using a smartphoneâ€™s embedded flash as a light source and the camera as a light sensor. Despite its widespread use, the method of PPG is susceptible to motion artifacts as physical displacements influence photon propagation phenomena and, thereby, the effective optical path length. Further, it is known that the wavelength of light used for PPG influences the photon penetration depth and we therefore hypothesized that influences of motion artifact could be wavelength-dependant. To test this hypothesis, we made measurements in 12 healthy volunteers of HR and NPV derived from reflection mode plethysmograms recorded simultaneously at three different spectral regions (red, green and blue) at the same physical location with a smartphone. We then assessed the accuracy of the HR and NPV measurements under the influence of motion artifacts. The analyses revealed that the accuracy of HR was acceptably high with all three wavelengths (all rs > 0.996, fixed biases: âˆ’0.12 to 0.10 beats per minute, proportional biases: r = âˆ’0.29 to 0.03), but that of NPV was the best with green light (r = 0.791, fixed biases: âˆ’0.01 arbitrary units, proportional bias: r = 0.11). Moreover, the signal-to-noise ratio obtained with green and blue light PPG was higher than that of red light PPG. These findings suggest that green is the most suitable color for measuring HR and NPV from the reflection mode photoplethysmogram under motion artifact conditions. We conclude that the use of green light PPG could be of particular benefit in ambulatory monitoring where motion artifacts are a significant issue.},

  abstract={A photoplethysmography (PPG) signal provides very useful information about a subject's hemodynamic status in a hospital or ubiquitous environment. However, PPG is very vulnerable to motion artifacts, which can significantly distort the information belonging to the PPG signal itself. Thus, the reduction of the effects of motion artifacts is an important issue when monitoring the cardiovascular system by PPG. There have been many adaptive techniques to reduce motion artifacts from PPG signals. In the present study, we compared a method based on the fixed-interval Kalman smoother with the usual adaptive filtering algorithms, e.g. the normalized least mean squares, recursive least squares and the conventional Kalman filter. We found that the fixed-interval Kalman smoother reduced motion artifacts from the PPG signal most effectively. Therefore, the use of the fixed-interval Kalman smoother can reduce motion artifacts in PPG, thus providing the most reliable information that can be deduced from the reconstructed PPG signals.}
